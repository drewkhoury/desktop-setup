Tips for configuring a new Mac.

# Homebrew - Package Manager

Use homebrew to install software for your desktop.

Install Homebrew:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

then:

```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Install Sofware Packages:

```
# desktop utilities # note: https://rectangleapp.com/ is the community replacement for spectacle
brew install --cask menumeters
#brew install --cask spectacle
brew install --cask rectangle

# browsers
brew install --cask google-chrome
brew install --cask firefox
brew install --cask brave-browser

# communication
brew install --cask slack
brew install --cask microsoft-teams
brew install --cask zoom
brew install --cask webex-meetings

# essentials
brew install wget
brew install git
brew install --cask iterm2
brew install htop

# dev
brew install --cask docker
brew install --cask virtualbox
brew install --cask vagrant

```

If you want to migrate away from a docker desktop install:

```
# if you have docker-desktop cask installed
brew uninstall docker

# to install the CLI
brew install docker 

# additionals
brew install docker-buildx docker-compose docker-credential-helper

brew install colima
```


## iTerm

If you're using iTerm consider adding the following color themes. Download the iTerm presets for the theme by running:

```
cd ~/Downloads
curl -o "Atom One Dark.itermcolors" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal/master/scheme/iterm/One%20Dark.itermcolors
curl -o "Atom One Light.itermcolors" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal/master/scheme/iterm/One%20Light.itermcolors
```

Then, in iTerm2 Preferences, under **Profiles and Colors**, go to **Color Presets... > Import...**, find and open the **Atom One Dark.itermcolors** file.

## zsh config (default shell on newer Macs)

Create a `~/.zshrc` file:

```
HISTSIZE=99999
HISTFILESIZE=999999
SAVEHIST=$HISTSIZE

alias history="history 1"
```

# Mac config (manual)

- Turn on: Vault & Firewall

# Git

```
ssh-keygen
git config --global --edit
```
